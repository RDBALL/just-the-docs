## [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

### Who is Roy Fielding?

* Roy Fielding is a data scientist who was a principal author of the HTTP specification

### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

* Because not all machines are able to interpret data in the same meaningful way. This could cause issues with incompatible machines.

### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

* They created a protocol that enabled machines to perform GET functions to accurately render the contents of web pages

### What does a `GET` do?

* Sends a request to a specified server to get certain data or resources

### What does a `POST` do?

* Sends data to an HTTP  server in order to create or update a resource

### What does `PUT` do?

* Sends data to a resource

### What does `PATCH` do?

* Applies partial modifications to a resource
