## [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

1. Greater efficiency

2. Engaged collaboration

3. Learning from fellow students

4. Social skills

5. Job interview readiness

6. Work environment readiness

### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

* I have found that I have benefited from paired programming the most with regard to learning from peers and engaging in collaboration. I feel that I am able to gain a better grasp of concepts if I am able to articulate how and why a certain concept works to another person.

### How does pair programming work?

* Paired programming can be done in a team of two individuals or more depending on the situation. One team member can be the driver (typing on their keyboard to write code) and the other team member is the navigator. The navigator is focused on the overall concept of design and is explicitly directing the driver as to what they should be coding.
