# Intro to React and Components

## Reading

[Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

### What is a “component”?

* A react component is a small element that is used to establish a specific piece of an app or website. Think of it as a single lego piece that can be modified without needing to completely tear down and reconstruct the overall lego model

### What are the characteristics of a component?

* Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

* Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

* Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

* Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

* Encapsulated − A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

* Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

### What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

* Ease of deployment − As new compatible versions become available, it is easier to replace existing versions with no impact on the other components or the system as a whole.

* Reduced cost − The use of third-party components allows you to spread the cost of development and maintenance.

* Ease of development − Components implement well-known interfaces to provide defined functionality, allowing development without impacting other parts of the system.

* Reusable − The use of reusable components means that they can be used to spread the development and maintenance cost across several applications or systems.

* Modification of technical complexity − A component modifies the complexity through the use of a component container and its services.

* Reliability − The overall system reliability increases since the reliability of each individual component enhances the reliability of the whole system via reuse.

* System maintenance and evolution − Easy to change and update the implementation without affecting the rest of the system.

* Independent − Independency and flexible connectivity of components. Independent development of components by different groups in parallel. Productivity for software development and future software development.

### What is “props” short for?

* Props is short for properties

### How are props used in React?

* Props pass data from one component to another

### What is the flow of props?

* Props have a one directional flow
