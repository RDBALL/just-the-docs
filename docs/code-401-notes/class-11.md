## Readings: [Event Driven Applications](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-event-driven-programming)

* What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?
  * `EventEmitter` is a class that helps us create a publisher-subscriber pattern in NodeJS.

  * With an event emitter, we can simply raise a new event from a different part of an application, and a listener will listen to the raised event and have some action performed for the event.

* What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?
  * Due to the divergence of computer use and the need for larger and complicated programs, programming paradigms have been continuously evolving. In modern times, Object-Oriented programming and Event-Driven Programming are the most used programming paradigm. These paradigms allows the user to be isolated from the internal workings of the program and can accepting multiple and complex instructions as needed. These programs also allow for reusability of codes and as such, different programs may use the same codes similar functions. These advantages led to the decline of procedural programming in favor of OOP and EDP.

* Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js
  * Using EDP gives the developer the ability to use maintain flexibility when needing to alter code. This also helps to ensure that your application can be modularized to help ensure ease of updates and upgrades in the future.
