### What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

* What I can bring is a rare combination of creative problem solving and effective communication. In addition to these two qualities, I have over 9 years of experience working with diverse partners from around the globe. In my previous career I was able to find success in every venture regardless of language barriers or differences in an individual's base knowledge. Effective communication and creative problem solving allowed me to find a path to success through ambiguity.

### What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

* Take a 10 minute break. Walk around and talk through the desired functionality out loud.
* Find an overt way to solve the problem and work on refactoring once the base functionality is complete.
* Seek out resources: TA's while in codefellows, any of the online resources such as stack overflow, youtube and general google searches etc.
