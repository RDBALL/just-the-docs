## The Command Line

### [The Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php) - What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one?

* The command line is reached through a command line editor. This is more commonly known as a terminal. Your terminal will allow you to decide which type of environment you want your command line editor to operate in. My current preference is using windows terminal with an ubuntu shell

### [Basic Navigation](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/navigation.php) - An introduction to the Linux directory system and how to get around it

* This was more of a review in navigating a file tree in unix. With WSL you are able to view your linux files using the `\\WSL$` file path to view your linux files on a 'networked' system.

### [More About Files](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/aboutfiles.php) - Find out some interesting characteristics of files and directories in a Linux environment

* It was interesting to know that linux does not regarde file extensions in the same way that a windows based system would. This makes me curious as to what markers a unix system would be using in order to determine the actual file type.

### [Manual Pages](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/manual.php) - Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning

* This is a helper feature that will display inside of your terminal when you invoke a `man <command to search>` manual lookup function. This is a nice feature to have if you need a reminder for what a particular function command can do. It would be useful to look up global commands as you are establishing your work station.

### [File Manipulation](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/filemanipulation.php) - How to make, remove, rename, copy and move files and directories

* Once again, more of a review of the terminal basics that I've become familiar with. The `rm -r` command has helped me whenever I've made an erroneous repo folder on my local machine.

### [Cheat Sheet](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/cheatsheet.php) - A quick reference for the main points covered in this tutorial

* Always great to have another quick reference guide for common terminal commands. I have a few cheat sheets from previous courses that I'll add this one to.
