## Learn CSS - Flexbox

### Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means

Flexbox is used to identify the best possible layout for elements that have different sizes. This is especially helpful when modifying multiple items of various sizes.

### Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis

The main axis of your flexbox is defined by your `flex-direction`. The main axis can either be set to row or column. Your cross axis will be the opposite direction of your main axis.

* If your `flex-direction` is set to `row`, your main axis will be row and your cross axis will be column

### How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

* `row-reverse` will reverse the visual order but not the logical order
* ‘column-reverse` will also reverse the visual order but not the local order

## CSS Layout - Flexbox

### What are some advantages of using flexbox over float?

Using a flexbox can potentially simplify element alignment by using a single axis versus using a `float` where you would need to float items left and right.

* Positioning child elements becomes easier with flexbox.
* Flexbox is responsive and mobile-friendly.
* Flex container’s margins do not collapse with the margins of its content.
* We can easily change the order of elements on our webpage without even making changes in HTML.
