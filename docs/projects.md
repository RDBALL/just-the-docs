## [Code 102 Final Website](https://rdball.github.io/lab04/)
* This website was created after learning the basics of HTML, CSS and JS. It begins with a prompt asking if the user likes cardiovascular exercises. If the user responds incorrectly, any other answer beside “yes”, they will continue to be prompted for the correct answer. After entering “yes”, they will be asked how healthy they believe their heart is on a scale from 1-5. This number will then result in a corresponding number of “strong heart” pictures being displayed within the webpage.

* The project showcases CSS and JS
